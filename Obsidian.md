![[README#what is Obsidian]]

# advantages
- multi-pane

	- images, pdfs, diagrams, audio - still with backlinks
- simultaneous folder structuring
# formatting text with markdown
Obsidian uses markdown to format text. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a way to format the style of text using the text itself instead of buttons in a user interface.

It might take some time getting used to it, but once you have the hang of it it's usually much more pleasant than something like google docs or word.

## math
Obsidian lets you embed $\LaTeX$ equations:
$$e^{i\pi}+1 = 0$$

## code
You can also add code snippets:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() { 
	printf("Hello World!"); 
	return 0; 
}
```
