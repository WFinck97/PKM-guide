One of the main advantages of [[networked note-taking]] using a program like [[Obsidian]] is the multiple overlappings ways in which we can structure and organize our notes, ultimately making it easier to find and discover relevant notes/information in the future, as well as minimize redundancy.

It's much less about having a *clean organizational structure* and much more about *ease of navigation and discovery*.
