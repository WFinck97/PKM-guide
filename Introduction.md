	- retention and comprehension struggles
- discovered the field of PKM ([[PKM - an overview#what is PKM]])
- profoundly changed the way I approach learning and note-taking
	- if I had known about this in university, I truly believe my experience would have been completely different
- increasing importance of continuous learning, this is a solid foundation for that
# purpose of this presentation

- help you get started on your own PKM journey

# training wheels for the mind bike
There is a [video of Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40B08nWoMk) talking about how computers are like bicycles for the mind. However, just like with actual bikes, we need to learn how to use them. We need training wheels.

Think of the tools I'm sharing as **training wheels** for your mind-bike.
