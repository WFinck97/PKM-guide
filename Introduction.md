# training wheels for the mind bike
There is a [video of Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40B08nWoMk) talking about how computers are like bicycles for the mind. However, just like with actual bikes, we need to learn how to use them. We need training wheels.

Think of the tools I'm sharing as **training wheels** for your mind-bike.
