# about
Networked note-taking is a way to structure our notes as a network rather than a hierarchical tree.

# graphs vs hierarchical trees
At first, networked notes may seem like a new and foreign concept. After all, we are trained to organize information as a hierarchical tree -- this is exactly how our computer file systems work. This is an outdated paradigm, coming from physical storage units where documents could only **exist in one place**.

But the truth is, **we are all very familar with graph-based note structures**. Just think about [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) for example. Navigating Wikipedia is really intuitive.

For some reason, though, this paradign hasn't penetrated personal computers and local file storage. There is no reason why there is only one way to access a file on a computer. With links, we can link a file/note from anywhere else, allowing notes to be stored **contextually** in addition to categorically.

Networked note-taking is like creating your own personal wiki, with a few added features which make navigating even more intuitive, for example:
- backlinks
- graph view

# networked note-taking applications
There are a number of different applications to choose from, my personal choice is [[Obsidian]] (which is free to use). However, there are many others, including:
- Roam Research
- Athens Research
- RemNote

They differ slightly, but they all provide the same **key features**.

# key features of networked note-taking
## link creation
The best apps let you create new pages very quickly and organize later. This saves time and effort as you don't need to spend any effort thinking about where exactly to store this note. Just create a new one then link to it from anywhere else that is relevant.
## backlinks
Backlinks allow you to see which pages link to the current page. This is helpful for understanding how notes are related, and being able to navigate backwards in addition to forwards through the graph.

## graph view
Graph views allow you to see the entire network of your notes, visually representing all of the relationships and structure of your notes. Some also allow you to have local graph views of specific notes.

## embedded notes
This means being able to view the contents of one note from a different note. Some apps even let you edit the embedded note, having changes reflected in the original file.


# guiding principles
Personal networked note-taking is relatively new with no definitive guides or techniques. Because of this, [[networked note-taking lacks well-developed principles and requires an exploratory mindset]].

With that said, there are a few guiding principles to follow:
- rather than thinking about categories for storage and structure, think about **context** and **discovery**
- the goal is to make it easy for your future self to find relevant info in whichever context you may find yourself in
