# about
Much of the information we consume is digital and mediated by computers. The amount of information available is incomprehensible and overwhelming. It is far too easy to feel *overloaded*, holding us back from navigating information with **comfort and confidence**. Ensuring we have "content inboxes" allows us to store and bookmark any form of content that seems interesting or may be of value, and then can be returned to when we are in the right mindset. I call this [[#delayed content consumption]].

# content inbox
There are a number of different services that can be used, here are a few:
- default browser bookmarks (for example, having an 'inbox' folder)
- [Raindrop.io â€” All-in-one bookmark manager](https://raindrop.io/) - browser extension and mobile app
- [Memex](https://memex.garden/) - social bookmark manager and web annotations
- [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) - read it later app
	- I use this one to save articles and read them at a later time
	- (pro tip: if you have a kindle, you can get articles sent to it automatically through Instapaper)

What is important here is that you regularly sort through your inbox and process the content in an appropriate way. This could look like:
- adding the website link to your notes
- reading through the website
- watching the video

# delayed content consumption
Using a content inbox is useful for delayed content consumption. Getting value out of content requires focused *attention* and *intention*. Trying to rush through an article in the middle of scrolling through social media serves little purpose. 

Using a content inbox allows us to set aside a time to give the piece of content the time it deserves.
