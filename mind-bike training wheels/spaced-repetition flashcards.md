# about
Spaced repetition flashcards is a way to train ourself to recall small units of information from memory, strengthening our ability to remember things. What makes spaced repetition different than regular flashcards, is that is uses a special formula to calculate the optimal interval between review, minimizing the amount of time spent reviewing flashcards.

# writing good flashcards
Writing good flashcards takes practice, especially if you are writing flashcards for more than simple things like vocabulary.

An additional benefit of writing flashcards is that even the act of writing good flashcards forces you to grapple with your own comprehension of any given subject. That is to say, even the practice of writing flashcards is an effective learning method.
