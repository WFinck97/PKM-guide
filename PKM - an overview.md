# what is PKM?
Broadly speaking, PKM consists of a set of tools and techniques for learning such that our knowledge **compounds** over time (see [[edtech should make the compounding effects of increasing knowledge explicit]]).

# the main categories of PKM
PKM is a broad field, and there are many different approaches. The following are three categories that I find most practical.
## information processing
- how do we navigate and process information?
- see [[information processing]] for more details
## note-taking
- how do we personalize and build understanding?
- see [[networked note-taking]] for more details
## memory
- how do we retain our understanding?
- see [[spaced-repetition flashcards]] for more details
