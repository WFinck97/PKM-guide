# about
Zettelkasten is an approach to networked note-taking that attempts to maximize the value of structuring our notes as a graph. Broadly speaking, it is a way to structure our notes such that the structure of graph itself provides another dimension of value. 

That is to say, **the relationship between notes adds meaning beyond just the contents of individual notes**, making the entirety of our notes **more than the sum of each individual note**. ^461dbb
