Learning and knowledge compound. We use previous knowledge to understand new knowledge. Our learning tools should help us make this process as explicit and clear as possible.

With [[networked note-taking]], and especially techniques like [[Zettelkasten]], we make this explicit by combining related notes, helping us see the bigger picture of our compounding knowledge.

With [[spaced-repetition flashcards]], this becomes explicit because we guarantee strong memory of basic units of knowledge, which are used to build new understanding: [[memory of basic components is necessary for understanding higher-order concepts]].
