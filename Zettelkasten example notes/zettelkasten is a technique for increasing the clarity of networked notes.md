Organizing our notes and digital resources in a graph structure (as opposed to a tree structure) can be **overwhelming**. 

*What* should constitute a 'node' in the graph?

*When* is it appropriate to link between nodes?

[[Zettelkasten provides some guiding principles for networked notes]]. It helps outline *what* should constitute a note and *when* links should be made.

These principles increase the *clarity* and *value* of our notes.

The value of our notes is not only encoded in the *contents*, but in the *structure* and *context*.

The structure and context is enabled by writing our notes as a graph.
