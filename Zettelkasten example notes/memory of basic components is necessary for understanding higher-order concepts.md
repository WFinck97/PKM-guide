Often, when we are having a hard time understanding a more complex concept (especially if they involve big equations), it's not that we aren't able to understand the concept or that it is too confusing. Usually, it's because we don't clearly understand the basic components, which are necessary for grasping the higher-level concept.

A great example of this are big equations. Looking at a big equation can be intimidating, but if we know exactly what each of the symbols mean, then we can look at the *entire* equation with clarity and understanding.

These kinds of situations are where [[spaced-repetition flashcards]] are extremely helpful. With a bit of practice, we can develop long lasting solid understanding of basic units of knowledge (for example, what $\int$ means).
