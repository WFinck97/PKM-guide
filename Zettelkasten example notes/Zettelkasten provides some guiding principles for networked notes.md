These principles are roughly that networked notes should be:
- **atomic** (short) ^ee7fc7
	- bc when linking, referencing *one* thing - allows for the structure to encode meaning and coherence in itself
- **concept-oriented**
	- to drive our thinking, paths become combinations of associated ideas and concepts that form a coherent train of thought (rather than a map of categories)
- **densly linked**
	- [[new ideas emerge from contextual novelty]]
- **associative and contextual over hierarchical and categorical**
	- we are not archiving information, but creating a space to help us *think*. A space for us to construct new ideas and understanding. The layout should reflect and facilitate this.

However, it's important to remember that [[networked note-taking lacks well-developed principles and requires an exploratory mindset]]. What works for some people may not work for others.
