This can be approached in a number of different ways. 

With [[networked note-taking]], attempting to write notes following zettlekasten-like principles ([[Zettelkasten provides some guiding principles for networked notes]]) forces us to break concepts down into manageble "chunk", which take the shape of atomic and densly linked notes.

With [[spaced-repetition flashcards]], material is divided into 'lightweight' flashcards that focus on as atomic of an idea as possible. The process of writing such flashcards helps us understand the conceptual building blocks as well as guarantee we won't forget them: [[memory of basic components is necessary for understanding higher-order concepts]].
